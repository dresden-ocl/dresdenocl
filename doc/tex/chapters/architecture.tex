This chapter introduces into the highly generic architecture of Dresden OCL.
Before the architecture is explained, some theoretical background is shortly 
presented. Further details of Dresden OCL's architecture can be found
in~\cite{braeuerEA:OCL2007} and~\cite{wilkeEA:MODELS2010}.



\section{The Generic Three Layer Metadata Architecture}
\label{architecture:genericLayers}

The OCL is a language that is always based on another modeling language (usually
the UML). Without another language used for modeling, it does not make any
sense to define constraints because OCL is used for constraint specification
but not for modeling itself. Thus, besides OCL, a modeling language is required
to define a model on that OCL constraints can be specified.

Each modeling language is defined in another language, its 
\keyword{Metamodeling Language}. For example, the UML's metamodel is defined
using the \keyword{\acf{MOF}}~\cite{spec:MOF2.0}, the standardized metameta
model of the OMG. The MOF is used to describe the UML metamodel that can be
used to model UML models. Generally spoken, each model requires a metamodel
that is used to describe the model. The model can be instantiated by model
instances (for example a UML class diagram can be instantiated by a UML object
diagram). The model can be enriched with OCL constraints that are defined on
the model (using an OCL metamodel / abstract syntax) and can then be verified
for instances of the model afterwards.

The OMG introduced the \keyword{MOF Four Layered Metadata
Architecture}~\cite{spec:MOF2.0}\cite[p. 16ff]{spec:UML2-2Inf} that is used to
arrange and structure the metamodel, the model, and the model's instances into
a layered hierarchy (see Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:mofLayers}). Generally,
four layers can be identified, the \keyword{Meta-Metamodel Layer (M3)}, the
\keyword{Metamodel Layer (M2)}, the \keyword{Model Layer (M1)}, and the
\keyword{Model Instance Layer (M0)}. The latest version of MOF allows to define
as much layers as required for a certain use case~\cite[p.~8f]{spec:MOF2.0}.

	Architecture~\cite{wilkeEA:MODELS2010}.}
	\label{pic:architecture:genericLayers}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

OCL constraints can be defined on both, metamodels and models to verify models
or model instances, respectively. E.g., one may use OCL to define rules on a
metamodel that must be ensured for every model modeled with the metamodel. But,
one may use OCL to define rules on a model (that must be verified for the
model's instances) as well. Thus, the four layer metadata architecture can be
generalized to a \keyword{Generic Three Layer Metadata
Architecture}~\cite{demuth:RGWS09} in the scope of an OCL definition (cf.
Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:genericLayers}).

On the \keyword{Mn+1 Layer} lies the metamodel that is used to define the model
that shall be constrained. The OCL abstract syntax extends the metamodel to
allow contexts of OCL constraints refering to elements of the model.

On the \keyword{Mn Layer} lies the model that is an instance of the metamodel
and can be enriched by the specification of OCL constraints.

Finally, on the \keyword{Mn-1 Layer} lies the model instance on that the OCL 
constraints shall be verified. Please note that in the context of such a
generic layer architecture, a model instance can be both a model (like an EMF 
Ecore model in Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:genericLayers}~(c))) or a set of 
objects (like Java run-time objects in
Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:genericLayers}~(b)). To provide a relationship
between the model instance's elements and the model's elements a mapping between
both is required. Thus, the model instance requires a description of a model
realisation that allows to reflect on the instance's elements (e.g., for Java
run-time objects such a realisation can be considered as a set of Java classes.
Each \code{java.lang.Object} allows to reflect on its \code{java.lang.Class}.
This \code{Class} can then be mapped to the corresponding model element in the
model by comparing the \code{Class}es name with the names of \code{Type}s
existing in the model).



\section{Dresden OCL's Package Architecture}

The package architecture of Dresden OCL is shown in
Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:modules}. The architecture can be separated into
five layers: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \keyword{API Layer},
  \item the \keyword{Tools Layer},
  \item the \keyword{Registry Layer},
  \item the \keyword{\acs{OCL} Layer},
  \item and the \keyword{Variability Layer}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!b]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/architecture/modules}
	\caption{The package architecture of Dresden OCL.}
	\label{pic:architecture:modules}
\end{figure}

The API layer provides the Facade of Dresden OCL that can be used by other
plug-ins to access the OCL tools of Dresden OCL. The Facade of Dresden OCL
is introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter:integration}.

The Tools Layer contains the Tools provided by Dresden OCL. These are: The
OCL Parser/Editor introduced in Section~\ref{intro:oclEditor}, the OCL
Interpreter introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter:interpretation}, the OCL22Java
Code Generator introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter:codeGeneration}, and the
OCL2SQL Code Generator introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ocl2sql}. Finally, the
\keyword{Model Browser} can be used to store imported models, and model
instances. The backend of the Model Browser is the \keyword{Model Bus} that
manages all metamodels and model instance types currently provided by Dresden
OCL. The model bus is located at the Registry Layer.

The OCL layer contains the OCL syntax and semantics used by the tools of Dresden
OCL. The OCL syntax and semantics are separated into three different packages.
\keyword{Essential OCL} contains the abstract syntax (or metamodel) of OCL that
is used by Dresden OCL and its tools. The \keyword{OCL Standard Library Model}
provides a modeled description of all operations that are provided by the OCL
Standard Library (as defined in \cite[Ch.~11]{spec:OCL2-3}). Finally the
\keyword{OCL Standard Library Semantics} provides an implementation of all
these operations that are used by the OCL Interpreter of Dresden OCL for OCL 
interpretation.

The last layer is the Variability Layer. The Variability layer contains the
\keyword{Pivot Model} and the \keyword{Model Instance Types} that are used to
connect Dresden OCL with various metamodels or types of model instances,
respectively. The Pivot Model is described more detailed in
Section~\ref{architecture:metaModelAdaptation}, the Model Instance Types are
explained in Section~\ref{architecture:modelInstanceAdaptation}. Further details
on both the Pivot Model and the Model Instance Types can be found 
in~\cite{braeuerEA:OCL2007} and~\cite{wilkeEA:MODELS2010}.

Dresden OCL has been developed as a set of Eclipse/\acs{OSGi} plug-ins. All
packages represent different Eclipse plug-ins. Additionally, \acl{DOT4Eclipse}
contains some plug-ins to provide \acs{GUI} elements such as wizards and 
examples to run \acl{DOT4Eclipse} with some simple models and OCL expressions.

	Metadata Architecture~\cite{wilkeEA:MODELS2010}.}
	\label{pic:architecture:genericArchitecture}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:genericArchitecture} shows the architecture of 
Dresden OCL with respect to the Generic Three Layer Metadata Architecture
(introduced in Section~\ref{architecture:genericLayers}). At the first sight, 
the architecture seems to be very complex. But do not be afraid! The 
architecture will now be explained step by step.


\subsection{The Adaptation of Meta-Models, Models and Model Instances}

As you can see, the left part of 
Figure~\ref{pic:architecture:genericArchitecture} shows the Generic Three Layer
Metadata Architecture. Metamodels, models and model instances are adapted and 
loaded into Dresden OCL. It could be argued that such an adaptation is expensive
and costly, but the opposite is the truth. The architecture of Dresden OCL allows
its users to adapt the toolkit to every metamodel and model instance type they 
want to. After the adaptation of a new metamodel or model instance type, they
can reuse the complete set of tools provided by Dresden OCL! Thus,
to adapt the OCL Interpreter to a new type of model instance, only one 
adaptation is required. The everything else comes for free!


\subsection{How Meta-Models and Models are Adapted}
\label{architecture:metaModelAdaptation}

As already said, the core feature of Dresden OCL is the \keyword{Pivot Model}
(a.k.a. \keyword{Model Types}). The pivot model is a metamodel that abstracts
from all other metamodels. It contains interfaces to define the structural 
parts of a model such as \code{Types}, \code{Namespaces}, \code{Operations} and
\code{Properties}. Furthermore, these interfaces provide methods to reason on
them (e.g., the interface \code{Namespace} provides a method
\code{getNestedNamespaces()} to retrieve all contained \code{Namespaces}).

Every metamodel users want to work with can be adapted to the pivot model. The
\keyword{Adapted Metamodel} must implement the interfaces of the pivot model 
and must adapt them to its metamodel elements. E.g., adapting the UML2 
metamodel, the interface \code{Type} from the pivot model must be adapted to 
the metamodel element \code{UML2Class}. Besides the adaptation of the pivot 
model, each metamodel must provide a \code{ModelProvider} that provides 
methods to load model resources of the adapted metamodel and adapts them to 
its pivot model implementation. The result is an \keyword{Adapted Model},
Dresden OCL can work with. Further details about the adaptation of metamodels to
the pivot model can be found in Chapter~\ref{chapter:pivotModelAdaptation}.


\subsection{How Model Instances are Adapted}
\label{architecture:modelInstanceAdaptation}

If the OCL Interpreter shall be used to interpret instances of an opened 
model, a second adaptation is required, an adaptation to the \keyword{Model 
Instance Type Model}. The model instance type model can be considered as similar
to the pivot model, but the purpose is different. If OCL constraints shall
be interpreted on run-time objects or values, operations and properties of these
run-time values must be accessible. E.g., if a constraint like \code{context 
Person inv: age >= 0} shall be interpreted, the property \code{age} of a
run-time object of the class \code{Person} must be accessed. The OCL 
interpreter does not accesses this property directly, but delegates the request 
to a \keyword{Model Instance Element} adaptation to let the model instance type
become exchangeable\footnote{To be honest, the interpreter does not access the
model instance element directly but uses the OCL standard library semantics
instead which delegate the request to the model instance element. But this is a
technical detail and not important in this context.}. Thus, Dresden OCL
contains a second model the \keyword{Model Instance Types} that can be
considered as an abstraction of all model instance types. The model instance
types define a set of interfaces to describe the elements of a model instance
(e.g., \code{IModelInstancePrimitiveType} and \code{IModelInstanceObject}).
These interfaces provide operations to reflect on the model instance elements
(e.g., the operation \code{IModelInstanceType.invokeOperation()} or the
operation \code{IModelInstanceElement.isTypeOf()}). The reflection mechanism
can be considered as similar to the mechanism provided by Java in the package 
\code{java.lang.reflect}.

Each model instance type users want to work with must be adapted to the model 
instance types. Besides an adaptation of the interfaces, also a 
\code{ModelInstanceProvider} must be implemented that is responsible to adapt 
model instance objects to the implemented interfaces. Due to the fact of this 
second adaptation, Dresden OCL is able to use the same OCL Interpreter for
different types of model instances! More details about the adaptation of model 
instances to Dresden OCL are available in 
Chapter~\ref{chapter:modelInstanceTypeAdaptation}.


\subsection{Coupling between Models and their Instances}

As mentioned above, different types of models can be connected with different 
types of instances. E.g., a UML class diagram could be implemented by a 
set of Java Classes (and their objects) or by an XML document. To 
maintain this loose coupling, metamodels and model instance types do not 
know each other. If a model instance is imported into Dresden OCL, a model (and
thus also a metamodel) has to be selected, to that the instance belongs to. The
objects of the instance are matched to the types of the selected model by the 
name of their types. E.g., a Java instance's \code{Object}s are matched by
associating their \code{Class}es' names to the names of the types of the
selected model.



\section{Summary}

This chapter introduced into the architecture and package structure of Dresden
OCL. The \keyword{Pivot Model} and the \keyword{Model Instance Types} have been
explained shortly. Also the relationships between the pivot model,
\keyword{Essential OCL} and the \keyword{OCL Standard Library} have been
presented. One may argue that the architecture seems to be complex and
complicate. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that Dresden OCL was designed
as generic as possible. Thus, Dresden OCL can be adapted to various different
kinds of meta-models and model instances without changing the OCL Parser nor
the OCL Interpreter! The currently existing adaptations to metamodels and model
instances are documented in Section~\ref{sect:info:models} and
Section~\ref{sect:info:modelinstances}, respectively.
